export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I’m Jagruthi Pulumati — an 18-year-old aspiring software developer with a curious mind and a passion for clean, functional design. I specialize in building responsive, modern web applications using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript — turning ideas into beautiful, scalable experiences.

With hands-on experience in live projects, I’ve worked on real-world applications that integrate APIs, handle dynamic data, and deliver seamless user interactions. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic, where smooth UI meets efficient code.

Every line I write is a step toward mastering my craft — and I’m just getting started.
