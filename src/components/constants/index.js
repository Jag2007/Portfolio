export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hi, Iâ€™m Jagruthi Pulumati â€” an 18-year-old aspiring software developer with a curious mind and a passion for clean, functional design. I specialize in building responsive, modern web applications using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript/TypeScript â€” turning ideas into beautiful, scalable experiences.

With hands-on experience in live projects, Iâ€™ve worked on real-world applications that integrate APIs, handle dynamic data, and deliver seamless user interactions. I thrive at the intersection of creativity and logic, where smooth UI meets efficient code.

Every line I write is a step toward mastering my craft â€” and Iâ€™m just getting started.

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi, I'm Jagruthi Pulumati â€” an 18-year-old software developer passionate about building modern, user-centric web experiences. I work with technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript to create responsive interfaces that are both beautiful and functional.

My journey began with a love for clean design and curiosity about how things work behind the screen. Today, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code â€” turning sketches and concepts into real, usable digital products.

I've had the chance to work on live projects that involved real-time API integration, dynamic routing, and smooth user interactions. These hands-on experiences taught me not just how to write code, but how to think through real-world problems, collaborate with teams, and deliver results that matter.

Whether it's building a personal portfolio, a creative tool, or a full-fledged frontend app â€” I aim to craft experiences that feel intuitive, fast, and meaningful.

Iâ€™m still growing, still learning, and still falling more in love with tech every day. This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m excited for whatâ€™s ahead. ðŸ’»âœ¨
